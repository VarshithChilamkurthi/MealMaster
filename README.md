Created the recipe app MealMaster using Storyboard and UIKit. Fetched the data asynchronously using async/await. 
Added Category scroll view using collectionview at the top.
On click of any desset, it will take the user to detailed view with instructions, ingredients, measure, more details.
Used segmentedcontrol to switch between them.
Will change UI or any other implementations upon request.
