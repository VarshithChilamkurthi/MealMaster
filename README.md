* Created the recipe app MealMaster using Storyboard and UIKit. Fetched the data asynchronously using async/await.
* Used MVVM design pattern for the project.
* Added Category scroll view using collectionview at the top.
* On click of any dessert, user will be redirected to detailed view with instructions, ingredients, measure and more details.
* Used segmentedcontrol to switch between them.
* Used cocoapods and added MBProgressHUD for the activity indicator. We can see a loading indicator until the data is fetched from the API and loaded.
* Will change UI or any other implementations upon request.
* Works with both Light mode ‚òÄÔ∏è and Dark mode üåë
* I'll try to implement similar app using SwiftUI as well. I'll create a different branch for it with in the same repository. But I might need some more time. Please let me know if you want me to implement that.
